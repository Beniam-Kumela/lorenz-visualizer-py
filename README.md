# Lorenz System Animator (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Lorenz system animator. It uses the following equations to generate data for the graph:

There is also a Lorenz graph generator for those that are interested which is capable of calculating more iterations in less time.

## Features

- Prompts user with animation settings and information.
- Animation provides live updates with where function is at in terms of constants.
- Real-time progress bar lets the user know how many frames have been compiled during rendering.
- Upon completing the animation, it lets the user know that it is saved to the directory in which the .exe file is located.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following Python libraries:

- matplotlib
- tqdm

If these are not already installed refer to step 4 in "Building and Running".

## Building and Running

### Windows

1. Download the .zip file by pressing the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
2. Go to folder that the file was downloaded to an extract all components to a directory.
3. While in file explorer, click on the bar with your directory:

4. Type cmd in this bar and press Enter.
5. If some of the dependencies are not already installed, put in the following lines one at a time in your command prompt:
```
pip install matplotlib
pip install tqdm
```
6. Run the following line in command prompt:
```
python -m animate.py
```
7. Once completed, the generated animation will be saved to this directory.

If you want to view the graphing function for the animation you can run graph.py in a virtual environment or in command line.

### Customization

If any edits want to be made to the code navigate to the animate.py file to make changes and run in a virtual environment.

## Example

Animation generated by animate.exe in green for 200 frames:

Graph generated by graph.py in blue for 10,000 iterations:
